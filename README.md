# Pomodoro
After reading John Sonmez books on Soft Skills for developers I thought I'd create an app that uses the Pomodoro technique described.

This app runs as a timer in the bottom right hand corner of your screen and stays on top of all other windows.

The arim of this is to help you focus on your tasks and give yourself breaks every 25 minutes.
